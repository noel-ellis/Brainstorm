# About the project
This is a demo project, designed with intent to test a productivity app idea I have in mind. This particular implementation comes with a set of flaws, as I currently prioritize quick proof-of-concept delivery over making an actually marketable product ready for deployment.
# Philosophy
- Turn ideas into actions, then manage them
- Notes are used to brainstorm ideas, todo lists are used to manage their execution. 
- Smooth transition between the two is crucial
# Features
## Security and Privacy
Users' personal data is end-to-end encrypted. Their private key gets stored in browser sessionStorage, for enhanced user experience. 
1. The server sends a webpage to the user, including encrypted personal data
2. Upon receiving the webpage, JavaScript running in the browser accesses the private key (which may have been decrypted using a passphrase) stored in `sessionStorage`, decrypts the data, and then processes it
3. The decrypted data is used to render the webpage's content for the user
4. The user interacts with the rendered webpage, possibly modifying the data
5. Before sending a request to the server, JavaScript code encrypts the modified data using the private key stored in `sessionStorage`
6. The encrypted data is included in the request and sent back to the server for processing
## Core
### Accounts
- email activation
### Folders
- multilevel
- colors/icons
- tags
### Todo lists
> Should projects have unique names? Considering the planned voice assistant
- attached to a folder
- flexible:
	- pull tasks from every note inside the parent folder
	- can contain tasks of their own
- priority (list-specific)
- due date (*optional*)
- named after the parent folder by default 
### Notes
> Should note tasks be differentiated by the notes they attached to? ***Yes, it's reflected in the db***
> How to trace some line in the note to its Task object?***Markdown contains ==task_id== and not the title***
- markdown
- tags
- tasks can be created inside a note; they are associated with a folder's todo list 
- pin
### Tasks
- always attached to a todo list
- optionally attached to a note
- priority (task-specific, local for the parent todo list)
- subtasks
- due date (*optional*)
- can be completed/failed
- open/closed status via optional timestamp
## Measurements
### Timers
- strictly attached to a task
- measures task performance time
### Task Due Date History
- measures task due date changes
- records timestamps
### Task Priority History
- measures task priority changes
- records timestamps
### Todo List Due Date History
- measures todo list due date changes
- records timestamps
### Todo List Priority History
- measures todo list priority changes
- records timestamps
### ðŸš§ Habits
> How do I create a habit? ***From a task OR latest task out of a list of ones***
> How does a new task spawn? ***clones the previous one***
> How does it change related tasks? ***doesn't change them***
> What if a task is attached to a note? ***add a new one next the previous one, differentiate by date***
> What if a task has a parent? ***detach*** ðŸš§
> What happens when the parent task closes? ***no parent tasks***
> Can task's due date change? ***Yes***
> 
- task factory
- ties all related tasks together, allowing habit-specific measurements
## Dashboards
### Activities Tab
- Browse through all todo lists, sorted and filtered
- Add specific tasks or whole lists to Focus Tab
### Focus Tab
- Contains relevant tasks/projects for today
### ðŸš§ Performance Tab
> What exact metrics?
> How is the data represented?
- contains all the metrics on a timeline
## Planned
### ðŸš§ Voice Assistant
- create new projects (folders with todo lists), dictate documents, and add new tasks
- add lists/tasks to focus 
- ask for metrics
